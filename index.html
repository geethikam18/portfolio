                    <p>• Published a CNN-based pneumonia diagnosis model with enhanced interpretability techniques (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM) in an international conference on IAAA, receiving the Best Paper Award.</p>
                    <p>• Conducted data analysis on large chest X-ray datasets, improving diagnostic accuracy and addressing interpretability challenges in real-world healthcare applications.</p>

                    <a class="project-title"><strong>A Glove that Translates Sign Language into Text and Speech:</strong></a>
                    <p>The glove integrates both flex sensors and a gyroscope to capture detailed hand and finger movements. The flex sensors measure the bending of fingers, while the gyroscope tracks hand orientation and rotation. By combining data from the flex sensors and gyroscope, the glove enhances the precision of gesture recognition and translation into text and speech. This dual-sensor approach ensures more accurate and reliable communication for sign language users.</p>
