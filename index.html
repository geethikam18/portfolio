      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Energy-Efficient IoT System Using RL and KD</h3>
        <p>This project introduces an IoT-based smart agriculture framework that utilizes federated learning, edge computing, and model optimization to reduce energy consumption. We simulated real-world sensor behavior using synthetic data and implemented clustering algorithms to improve resource management. Two models were compared ‚Äî Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) ‚Äî with KD achieving a smoother and more accurate 8.41% reduction in energy usage. The study highlights KD as the most effective approach for balancing generalization and efficiency in smart farming.</p>

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition</h3>
        <p>We explored Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM with multi-head attention across four public datasets. LSTM outperformed other models with 99.91% accuracy, leveraging its strength in learning temporal patterns. CNN also showed promising spatial feature extraction, while Bi-LSTM faced overfitting. This project demonstrates how hybrid models can optimize real-time SER applications in healthcare and customer service, and paves the way for transformer-based and multimodal SER systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Multi-head Attention </p>

        <h3>Explainable AI for Pneumonia Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a CNN-based model combined with XAI techniques like LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM. The model enhances trust and transparency in healthcare by explaining predictions visually, helping radiologists interpret results. Trained on large medical datasets, the model achieved high accuracy while improving interpretability ‚Äî addressing a crucial challenge in real-world medical AI systems. The paper was awarded Best Paper at the IAAA conference.</p>

        <h3>Smart Glove for Sign Language Translation</h3>
        <p>This IoT-based wearable device translates sign language into text and speech in real time. The glove integrates flex sensors to track finger movement and a gyroscope to detect hand orientation. Signals are processed to recognize specific gestures and convert them into meaningful output. The system enhances communication accessibility for the hearing- and speech-impaired, offering a real-time, accurate, and user-friendly solution to bridge language barriers.</p>
